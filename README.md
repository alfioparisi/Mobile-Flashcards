# Mobile FlashCards

## Overview

Last project for Udacity, React nanodegree.
This is a mobile app built using [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
Its purpose is to help in the study by playing quizzes. Users can create their own `deck` containing questions related to a specific argument, then play the quiz for that deck. Also, the app uses local notifications to remind the user to play a quiz at a set time every day.

## Run the app

To run the app you'll need [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/index.html) on your mobile phone or emulator.
Once you run `npm start` and the app is running open Expo and scan the QR code in the terminal. The app will finally open.
